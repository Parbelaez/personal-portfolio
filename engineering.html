                <p>
                    I am a musician since I was 7 years old and my childhood dream was to be an audio engineer. The
                    problem:
                    the profession
                    did not exist in Colombia ... the solution: study electronic engineering and then opt for a
                    scholarship
                    for a master's
                    degree in audio.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    But sometimes life just happens. The need for music was supplied while playing in my band: Johnie
                    All
                    Stars. My job as a
                    Telecommunications Engineer was stable, and my other passion, writing, was becoming more and more
                    prominent.

                    After 9 years of working in all the technical positions that a cellular network can have, I decided
                    to
                    get to know the
                    world through my profession. I then went to work as a consultant in several countries as a mobile
                    network optimizer,
                    until I ended up in Berlin, where after a year working in network access, I took the position of
                    crowdsourcing project
                    manager. Something completely new that introduced me to the IT world. And finally, I developed the
                    home
                    internet
                    benchmarking system for Germany, which consists of 3 products: a <span class="img-wrapper"><a

                    I am currently developing a new project based on a web app for the movie industry and estimated to
                    be
                    released in early
                    2024.
