Welcome to my portfolio,

It is difficult for me to correctly show all my capabilities in a single CV, therefore, I decided to create a portfolio with all my working experience and hobbies with which I can make a living, or could be useful for the visitors of the webpage interests.

## Concept for the UI / UX

As the portfolio is really eclectic, it should be as clear and simple as possible.

The logo was inspired by an AI-generated one, from [LOOKA](https://looka.com/), but created manually using Google fonts and [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons

The color scheme is based on different shades of grey, except for the tiles, which were thought as pastel, so their inherent opacity matches the seriousness of the header and the footer.

### Fonts
Google Fonts was the source of the typography:

[Poppins](https://github.com/itfoundry/poppins): is a geometric sans serif typeface developed by Indian Type Foundry and Jonny Pinhorn.

### Icons and images

Icons were used directly from [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

Images were obtained from my archive and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)

## Content Pages

### index.html -landing page-

I chose to use a tiling system in the index to be similar to a mobile app, with an icon, title, catchphrase, and a brief description. And, that's the main reason behind the decision to use a back-to-menu button, instead of a list of links.

The footer is composed as well of icons of my normally used social networks that could help the user know more about my work.

#### Hamburguer Menu

To avoid using JavaScript for this project, it was decided to create a hamburger menu by only using HTML (SVG) and CSS. The ideas came from the YouTubers: Kevin Powell and Web Dev Simplified.

[How To Build An Animated Hamburger Menu With Only CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dAIVbLrAb_U).

As it can be seen, the hamburguet consist of 3 svg creating the bars, and a non-visible checkbox to be used as a button. If a button were used instead, JavaScript would have been needed to catch the click event.

### Engineering

This one was used to practice the usage of the background image, and the hover displaying and image on the word: probe.

#### Used Technologies

All the previous, plus some snippets from [Codepen](https://codepen.io/wall-e/pen/zvvgBe)](https://codepen.io/wall-e/pen/zvvgBe).

### Writing

This is an only-text webpage. It is not meant to have more information than that until the book is published or the scripts are ready.

### Film

For this page, YouTube iframes were used, so the visitor can check part of my multimedia work.

### Music

For this page, Spotify iframes were used, along with a copyrighted photo with its corresponding mention.
Some audio clips can be inserted in the future, as the work on the album progresses.

### Photography

A set of personal photos. Some of them are not part of my Instagram account.
Flexbox was used to create the matrix.

## Bug reports and errors

### Known bugs

None so far

### Fixed bugs

- Images not loading due to the wrong path.
- "a" attribute is given mistakenly to the image contained in it.
- Resizing issues due to the min-max height threshold not being defined.

### HTML Errors

* The w3c html validation is considered as OK, as the errors are coming directly from the iframes given by the YouTube and Spotify codes.

YouTube: *"Error: The frameborder attribute on the iframe element is obsolete. Use CSS instead."*

Spotify: *"Error: Bad value 100% for attribute width on element iframe: Expected a digit but saw % instead.*

### CSS Errors

- The w3c html validation is considered as OK, as the errors are coming directly from the fonts and icons imports from Google Fonts and Fontawesome.
